# Code Quality — No Slop

Write the code a senior engineer would be happy to maintain in two years. Correct, small, obvious, verified.

## Principles

1. **Solve the stated problem.** Not the general version of it. No config options, abstraction layers, plugin systems or "future-proofing" nobody asked for. Three similar lines beat a premature abstraction; extract on the third real repetition.
2. **Read before you write.** Match the project's existing patterns, naming and structure. Search for an existing utility before writing a new one. A new pattern needs a reason.
3. **Never invent APIs.** If you are not certain a function, option, filter or hook exists in the installed version, check `node_modules`, the lockfile version, or official docs. Guessing is the number one source of slop.
4. **Make illegal states unrepresentable.** Precise types, discriminated unions, enums over magic strings, validation at boundaries (user input, network, storage), trust inside.
5. **Fail loudly at the right level.** Handle errors where you can do something meaningful (retry, fallback, user message). Otherwise let them propagate. Never swallow (`catch {}`), never log-and-continue silently.
6. **Delete freely.** Remove dead code, unused imports, stale flags and commented-out blocks. Git remembers.

## Deliberate simplicity: `ponytail:` notes

Over-engineering usually comes from fear of the future. Answer that fear in writing instead of in code: build the simple version and leave a `ponytail:` comment at the seam.

```ts
// ponytail: single currency (COP) hardcoded; extend when the client sells abroad (add a currency field + Intl.NumberFormat per locale).
```

Format: `ponytail: <what was simplified>; extend when <concrete trigger> (<how>)`. In the file's comment syntax (`//`, `#`, `/* */`, `{% comment %}`, `<!-- -->`).

Rules:
- Use it whenever you skip an abstraction, option, configuration, plugin or generalization that someone might reasonably expect. The note is the justification for NOT building it.
- The trigger must be concrete and observable ("when there are 3+ payment providers", "if the client needs to edit them"), never "if needed" or "in the future".
- One note per seam, next to the code it describes. No ponytail notes for things nobody would build anyway.
- The reverse rule: adding complexity beyond the request (layers, options, generic helpers, plugins) needs a one-line justification in the feature file or PR. Simplicity is the default and does not need defending; complexity does.
- When a trigger happens, implement the extension and delete the note in the same change.
- Compatible with the Ponytail plugin (DietrichGebert/ponytail), which uses the same marker: if it is installed, its rules and `/ponytail-review` / `/ponytail-debt` apply too; the `extend when <trigger>` part is Sumitsubo's addition.
- `/sumi:ship` lists the notes added in the diff under "Deliberate simplifications" in the PR, so the client and reviewers see the seams.

## Size and shape

- Functions do one thing; if you need "and" to describe it, split it. Aim < 40 lines.
- Files have one reason to change. Components > ~200 lines or modules > ~300 lines need a look (stack packs may set tighter limits; the tighter one wins).
- Max nesting depth 3. Use early returns and guard clauses.
- Parameters: ≤ 3 positional; beyond that, an options object with named fields.
- Pure logic separate from I/O and framework glue, so it can be tested without mocks.

## Naming

- Names say what, not how: `unpaidInvoices`, not `filteredList2`. Booleans read as questions: `isOpen`, `hasStock`, `canEdit`.
- Functions are verbs (`calculateShipping`), event handlers describe the event (`handleSubmit`, `onCartUpdated`).
- No abbreviations except universal ones (`id`, `url`, `i` in short loops). No `data`, `info`, `item`, `temp`, `helper`, `utils2`, `manager` without a domain noun.
- Units in names when ambiguous: `timeoutMs`, `priceCents`.

## Comments

Comment **why**, never what. Document non-obvious constraints, workarounds (with a link to the issue), business rules and invariants. No narrating comments (`// loop over items`), no banner art, no AI-style section headers in code (`// ===== HELPER FUNCTIONS =====`).

## Dependencies

Before adding a package: can the platform do it (native `<dialog>`, `Intl`, `fetch`, CSS)? Is it maintained, typed, tree-shakeable, and is its size justified? Prefer one well-chosen dependency over three overlapping ones. Never add a dependency to save five lines.

## Tests

- Test behavior through public interfaces, not implementation details.
- New logic with branches → tests. Bug fix → a test that fails before the fix.
- Tests are code: same naming and clarity rules. One reason to fail per test.
- Use the project's test runner and conventions; don't introduce a second one.

## AI slop tells — never ship these

- `any`, `as unknown as`, non-null `!` sprinkled to silence the compiler.
- Defensive checks for impossible states; optional chaining on values that are always defined.
- try/catch around code that cannot throw, or catch blocks that only `console.log`.
- Wrapper functions that just call another function with the same arguments.
- Over-commented trivial code; JSDoc that restates the signature.
- Placeholder logic left behind: `// TODO: implement`, mock data in production paths, `console.log` debugging.
- Inconsistent style within the same file (mixing async/await and `.then`, two naming conventions).
- "Enterprise" structure for a small feature: interfaces with one implementation, factories, service-repository-controller layers for a single CRUD call.
- Rewriting working code that wasn't part of the task.

## Done checklist

- [ ] The change does what was asked, nothing more; scope creep noted as follow-ups.
- [ ] Types pass, linter passes with zero new warnings, formatter applied.
- [ ] Tests added/updated and passing; you ran them and saw the output.
- [ ] No dead code, debug logs, TODO stubs or commented-out code.
- [ ] Errors handled at the right level with useful messages.
- [ ] Every API used exists in the installed version.
- [ ] Diff reads cleanly top to bottom; a reviewer would not ask "why is this here?".
