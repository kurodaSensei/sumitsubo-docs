Use when adding content types, fields, options pages, structured data, forms or integrations (e.g. WhatsApp links) to a native block theme, or when tempted to install a plugin for something core can do."

# Native Features (core APIs over plugins)

Default to WordPress core. Every plugin is a dependency the client inherits: install one only when it does something substantial that core can't (forms delivery, multilingual content), and say why in the PR.

## Content model

- `register_post_type` / `register_taxonomy` on `init` in `inc/cpt.php`, always with `show_in_rest => true` (required for the block editor), sensible `supports`, `has_archive` and rewrite slugs in the site's language. Create `single-<cpt>.html` and `archive-<cpt>.html` templates.
- Fields: native meta boxes (`add_meta_box` + nonce + capability check + sanitize on save) or `register_post_meta` with `show_in_rest`, `single`, `type` and `sanitize_callback` when blocks need the value. No ACF.
- Small fixed lookups (category colors, icons) can be a PHP map function; mark it with a `ponytail:` comment and add term meta UI only when the client must edit it.
- Helper functions prefixed with the theme (`{theme}_...`), each documented with its return type.

## Site-wide options

Settings API page (`add_menu_page`/`add_options_page` + `register_setting` with a `sanitize_callback` + `add_settings_field`) for things like the WhatsApp number, default CTA label or advisor name. Expose getters (`{theme}_wa_number()`) so blocks never read options directly.

## Integrations as helpers

Build reusable helpers instead of repeating logic in blocks: e.g. `{theme}_wa_url( $message )` (sanitized number + `rawurlencode` message), `{theme}_tel_href()`, a screen-reader "opens in a new tab" string. Floating buttons injected via `wp_footer` with accessible names.

## Icons and media

- `{theme}_icon_svg( $slug )` returns inline SVG from a fixed map (stroke `currentColor`, `aria-hidden` on decorative use). One icon language for the whole site.
- SVG uploads only with sanitization and restricted to admins (`upload_mimes`, `wp_check_filetype_and_ext`, `wp_handle_upload_prefilter`).

## Structured data

`inc/schema.php` prints JSON-LD in `wp_head` for the business type (TravelAgency, LocalBusiness, Organization), plus per-template types (Product/Offer, FAQPage, BreadcrumbList) built from real content. Validate with Google's Rich Results test; record the evidence.

## Forms

Contact Form 7 (or the client's tool) with your own markup: disable autoformatting (`wpcf7_autop_or_not` → false) and write the form template with the theme's grid and labels. Load the plugin's assets only on pages that contain the form (`wp-performance-audit`). Labels, errors and success messages must meet `sumi:a11y`.

## i18n

Theme strings through `__()` with the theme text domain; content translation via Polylang. Patterns and block defaults are translatable, so the same theme serves every language.

## Security baseline

Escape late (`esc_html`, `esc_attr`, `esc_url`, `wp_kses_post`), sanitize early (`sanitize_text_field`, `absint`, custom callbacks), nonces + `current_user_can` on every save handler and admin action, `$wpdb->prepare` for any raw query, `if ( ! defined( 'ABSPATH' ) ) exit;` at the top of every PHP file.

## Done checklist

- [ ] No plugin added for something core does; any new plugin justified.
- [ ] CPTs/taxonomies/meta visible in the block editor (`show_in_rest`).
- [ ] Every save path: nonce, capability, sanitization.
- [ ] Options read through helpers; schema validated.
