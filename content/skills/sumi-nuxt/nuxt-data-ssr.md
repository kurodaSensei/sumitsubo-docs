# Nuxt Data, SSR and Performance

SSR renders HTML on the server, serializes the data into a payload, and the client hydrates the same
tree. Every rule here protects one of three things: **the server and client render identical HTML**,
**data is fetched once (not twice)**, and **the user gets meaningful pixels fast**.

## Core principles

1. **Fetch in setup with `useFetch`/`useAsyncData`**, so data is fetched on the server and
   transferred in the payload. Raw `$fetch` in setup double-fetches (server, then client again).
2. **Every async data call has a deliberate key.** Same key = shared, deduplicated data across
   components (Nuxt 4 singleton data layer). Different data must never share a key.
3. **Ship only what the page renders.** Trim with `pick`/`transform` or a dedicated server endpoint.
4. **Render deterministic markup.** No time, randomness, locale or browser state in SSR output.
5. **Measure against budgets**, not vibes: LCP < 2.5s, INP < 200ms, CLS < 0.1 on a mid-range mobile
   (`sumi:performance`).

## Choosing the primitive

| Need | Use |
| --- | --- |
| Data needed for initial render, from your API | `useFetch('/api/x')` |
| Data from an SDK/function (Firestore, CMS client) | `useAsyncData('key', () => fn())` |
| User-triggered action (submit, delete, load more) | `$fetch` in an event handler |
| Non-critical data (below fold, recommendations) | `lazy: true` (+ `server: false` if not SEO-relevant) |
| Run something once per request across components | `callOnce` (verify behavior for your version) |
| Request-scoped shared value | `useState('key', init)` |

```ts
// GOOD: typed, keyed, trimmed, with explicit states
const route = useRoute()
const { data: project, status, error } = await useFetch(`/api/projects/${route.params.id}`, {
  pick: ['id', 'name', 'status', 'updatedAt'],
})
if (error.value?.statusCode === 404) throw createError({ statusCode: 404, fatal: true })
```

```ts
// BAD: double fetch, untyped, no error state
const project = ref<any>(null)
onMounted(async () => { project.value = await $fetch(`/api/projects/${id}`) })
```

### Key and option rules

- `useFetch` derives a key from URL + options. With `useAsyncData`, always pass an explicit key that
  encodes every input: `` `project:${id}` ``, `` `projects:${page}:${sort}` ``.
- Reactive params: pass refs/getters in `query`/URL so it refetches automatically. Do not add a
  `watch` that calls `refresh()` for the same thing.
- Nuxt 4 defaults: `data` is a `shallowRef` (set `deep: true` only if you mutate nested fields), and
  the empty value is `undefined`. Use `default: () => []` for list shapes.
- Use `status` (`idle | pending | success | error`) for UI states, not ad-hoc `loading` refs.
- `getCachedData` controls reuse of payload/static data across navigations; use it to avoid refetching
  stable data on client navigation. `refreshNuxtData(key)` / `clearNuxtData(key)` to invalidate.
- Never `await` multiple independent `useFetch` calls in sequence when they can run in parallel;
  combine with `Promise.all` inside one `useAsyncData`, or make the secondary ones `lazy`.

## Hydration mismatches

Root causes and fixes (full catalog in `references/hydration.md`):

| Cause | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| `window`, `localStorage`, `matchMedia` read during setup | Read in `onMounted`, or wrap in `<ClientOnly>` with a same-size fallback |
| `new Date()`, `Date.now()`, relative time ("3 min ago") | Format from a server-provided timestamp with a fixed timezone; render relative time after mount |
| `Math.random()`, `crypto.randomUUID()` for ids | `useId()` |
| `toLocaleString()` without explicit locale/timezone | `Intl.DateTimeFormat('es-CO', { timeZone: 'America/Bogota' })` with explicit args |
| Auth-dependent markup when server has no session | Forward auth (cookie) to the server, or render that region client-only with a skeleton |
| Invalid HTML nesting (`<div>` in `<p>`, `<a>` in `<a>`) | Fix the markup; the browser rewrites it and Vue sees a mismatch |
| Theme/dark mode from localStorage | Cookie-based preference or `@nuxtjs/color-mode`, which injects a pre-hydration script |

Never silence mismatches with `<ClientOnly>` around large page sections; that throws away SSR for
SEO and LCP. Use it for small, genuinely client-only islands and give it a `#fallback` of equal size
to avoid CLS.

## Payload and bundle size

- Inspect `/_payload.json` or `window.__NUXT__` on heavy pages; if it is larger than the HTML that
  renders it, you are shipping unused data. Use `pick`, `transform`, or a purpose-built endpoint.
- Never put secrets or internal fields in data returned to `useFetch`; payload is public.
- Non-serializable values (class instances, Firestore `Timestamp`, `Map`) need conversion in
  `transform` or a custom payload reducer.
- Code-split heavy components with `Lazy*` + `v-if`; consider lazy hydration (`hydrate-on-visible`,
  `hydrate-on-interaction`) for below-fold interactive islands (verify for your Nuxt version).
- Third-party scripts via `@nuxt/scripts` or deferred loading; never synchronous in `<head>`.
- Analyze with `nuxi analyze`. Every dependency over ~20 kB gzipped needs a reason.

## Caching layers

1. **routeRules** (`prerender`, `isr`, `swr`, `cache`) for whole responses at the edge/server.
2. **`defineCachedEventHandler` / `cachedFunction`** in Nitro for expensive upstream calls.
3. **Payload reuse** on the client via `getCachedData` for navigation.
4. **HTTP cache headers** on static assets (Nuxt hashes them; keep immutable caching).
Pick the outermost layer that is correct for the data's freshness needs. Authenticated, per-user data
is never cached at a shared layer.

## SEO and meta

```ts
useSeoMeta({
  title: () => project.value?.name ?? 'Project',
  description: () => project.value?.summary,
  ogTitle: () => project.value?.name,
  ogImage: () => project.value?.coverUrl,
  twitterCard: 'summary_large_image',
})
```

- `useSeoMeta` (typed) over raw `useHead({ meta })`. Use getters for reactive values.
- Set `app.head.htmlAttrs.lang` and a title template once. Canonical URLs via `useHead({ link })`.
- Correct status codes for missing content (`createError` 404) so pages are not soft-404s.
- Structured data (JSON-LD) only when it reflects visible content; consider `nuxt-schema-org`.

## Images and fonts

- `@nuxt/image`: `<NuxtImg>`/`<NuxtPicture>` with `width`/`height` (or aspect-ratio) to prevent CLS,
  `sizes` for responsive srcset, `<NuxtPicture format="avif,webp">` when you need multiple formats (`<NuxtImg>` takes a single `format`).
- The LCP image: `loading="eager"`, `fetchpriority="high"`, `preload`; never lazy-load it.
  Everything below the fold: `loading="lazy"`.
- `@nuxt/fonts`: self-hosted, subsetted, `font-display: swap`, with metric-matched fallbacks to reduce
  CLS. Limit families and weights (two families, three or four weights total is a reasonable cap).
- Font and image choices come from `DESIGN.md` tokens; do not introduce new families ad hoc.

## Anti-patterns (AI slop tells)

- `onMounted` + `$fetch` + `ref` for initial page data (React `useEffect` habit).
- `useAsyncData` without a key, or two different queries sharing one key.
- A `watch` on route params calling `refresh()` when the URL is already reactive.
- `<ClientOnly>` around the whole page to "fix hydration".
- `new Date().toLocaleDateString()` in templates.
- Returning full Firestore documents (with internal fields) to the client payload.
- Sequential awaits of independent requests causing waterfalls.
- Hero image with `loading="lazy"`, no dimensions, or a 3000px JPEG.
- Importing a whole utility library (`lodash`, `moment`) for one function.
- `ssr: false` globally to avoid thinking about hydration.

## Done checklist

- [ ] Initial-render data uses `useFetch`/`useAsyncData`; actions use `$fetch`.
- [ ] Every async call has a unique, input-complete key; UI handles `pending`, `error`, empty.
- [ ] No hydration warnings in the browser console on hard reload of every touched page.
- [ ] Payload contains only rendered fields; no secrets; non-serializable values transformed.
- [ ] LCP image is eager/high priority with dimensions; other images lazy; fonts via `@nuxt/fonts`.
- [ ] `useSeoMeta` set; correct 404 status for missing entities.
- [ ] Caching layer chosen per route; no shared caching of per-user data.
- [ ] Lighthouse/Web Vitals on mobile profile meet budgets (`sumi:performance`).

## Hydration mismatch catalog and fixes

### How to diagnose

1. Hard reload the page with devtools console open. Vue logs the mismatching node in dev.
2. Compare View Source (server HTML) with the Elements panel right after load.
3. Bisect: wrap suspect subtrees in `<ClientOnly>` temporarily to locate the culprit, then fix the
   cause and remove the wrapper.
4. Check for browser extensions injecting markup (test in a clean profile) before blaming code.

### Patterns

#### Browser-only APIs

```ts
// BAD: crashes on server or renders different branch
const isMobile = window.innerWidth < 768

// GOOD: server and first client render agree (false), then update after mount
const isMobile = ref(false)
onMounted(() => {
  const mq = window.matchMedia('(max-width: 767px)')
  isMobile.value = mq.matches
  mq.addEventListener('change', (e) => { isMobile.value = e.matches })
})
```

Better still: solve layout differences with CSS (media/container queries) so there is no JS branch.

#### Dates and time zones

The server likely runs in UTC; the user's browser does not. Formatting without an explicit time zone
produces different strings.

```ts
const fmt = new Intl.DateTimeFormat('es-CO', {
  dateStyle: 'medium', timeZone: 'America/Bogota',
})
const label = computed(() => fmt.format(new Date(event.value.startsAt)))
```

For "time ago" labels: render the absolute date on the server inside `<time datetime="...">`, then
swap to relative text in `onMounted`. Or render relative text client-only with a fixed-width fallback.

#### User-specific content

If the server cannot see the session, it renders the logged-out view and the client renders the
logged-in view. Options:
- Session cookie readable on the server (`useCookie`, or Firebase session cookies verified in a Nitro
  middleware) so both sides agree.
- Route is `ssr: false` (dashboards).
- Small auth-dependent island (`<ClientOnly>`) with a skeleton of identical dimensions.

#### Persisted UI state (theme, dismissed banners)

localStorage is invisible to the server. Use a cookie (`useCookie('theme')`) so SSR renders the
correct variant, or a module that injects a blocking inline script before hydration
(`@nuxtjs/color-mode`).

#### Invalid HTML

The browser's parser silently fixes invalid nesting, so its DOM differs from Vue's virtual tree.
Common offenders: block elements inside `<p>`, interactive inside interactive (`<button>` in `<a>`),
`<tr>` directly inside `<table>` without `<tbody>` in some cases, `<li>` outside lists.
Run the HTML validator on rendered output when in doubt.

#### Non-deterministic ordering

`Object.keys` on data assembled in different order, `Set` iteration of async-filled data, or
`sort()` with an unstable comparator. Sort deterministically on the server and transfer the result.

### Data fetching pitfalls that look like hydration bugs

- `useAsyncData` with `server: false` returns no data during hydration; the first client render must
  match the server's empty/pending state. Render a skeleton for `pending`.
- Key collision: two components using the same key for different data get each other's payload.
- Mutating the payload data object in place on the client before mount.

### Firestore data in the payload

`Timestamp`, `DocumentReference` and `GeoPoint` are not plain JSON. Convert in `transform`:

```ts
const { data } = await useAsyncData(`post:${slug}`, () => getPost(slug), {
  transform: (p) => p && ({ ...p, publishedAt: p.publishedAt.toMillis() }),
})
```

Or convert at the repository boundary so components never see SDK types.
