# Firebase and Firestore

Firestore is not a relational database and not a free-form JSON bucket. It is a document store where
**you pay per document read**, **queries must be served by an index**, and **security rules are the
only backend** for anything the client SDK touches. Design for the queries the UI runs, then write
rules as if every client is hostile.

## Core principles

1. **Query-first modeling.** List every screen and the exact query it runs before creating a
   collection. The shape of documents follows the reads, not an ER diagram.
2. **Reads are the cost and latency unit.** One screen should cost a small, bounded number of reads,
   independent of total data size. Never count or aggregate by reading every document.
3. **Rules are the backend.** Deny by default. Validate auth, ownership, document shape, field
   types, allowed fields and immutable fields on every write. Test them in the emulator.
4. **Server for privilege, client for convenience.** Anything involving money, roles, cross-user
   writes or secrets goes through Cloud Functions or Nitro with firebase-admin.
5. **Modular SDK only, tree-shaken, initialized once.** No compat imports.

## Modeling rules

- Top-level collections for entities you query across owners (`projects`, `orders`). Subcollections
  for data always accessed through a parent (`projects/{id}/tasks`). Use collection-group queries
  when you must query subcollections across parents.
- **Denormalize what lists display.** A task list showing assignee name stores `assignee: { uid, name, photoURL }`
  in the task. Accept the write-time fan-out; update copies with a function when the source changes.
- **Aggregation documents** for counters and summaries (`projects/{id}/stats/summary` or fields on the
  parent), updated in a transaction or by a trigger. For high write rates, use sharded counters.
  For occasional counts, `getCountFromServer` / `getAggregateFromServer` (bills per batch of index
  entries, not per doc - verify current pricing).
- Keep documents well under the 1 MiB limit; never use an ever-growing array or map (comments, logs)
  inside a document. Unbounded lists are subcollections.
- Avoid sustained writes to a single document beyond roughly 1 per second, and avoid monotonically
  increasing document IDs or indexed timestamps on very high write volumes (hotspotting).
- Store timestamps as `serverTimestamp()` on write; store money as integer minor units.
- Version your schema: a `schemaVersion` field makes migrations tractable.

Worked modeling examples: `references/modeling.md`.

## Queries, indexes, pagination

```ts
import { collection, query, where, orderBy, limit, startAfter, getDocs } from 'firebase/firestore'

const q = query(
  collection(db, 'projects'),
  where('ownerId', '==', uid),
  where('status', '==', 'active'),
  orderBy('updatedAt', 'desc'),
  limit(20),
  ...(cursor ? [startAfter(cursor)] : []),
)
```

- Every composite query needs a composite index; commit them in `firestore.indexes.json` (export
  with `firebase firestore:indexes`), never only through console links.
- Paginate with cursors (`startAfter(lastSnapshot)`) and `limit`. Never `offset`: skipped docs are
  still billed and slow.
- `in`/`array-contains-any`/`or()` have value limits (verify current max) - they are not a join.
- No client-side filtering of large result sets "because the query was hard". Change the model.
- Use `withConverter` (or a repository layer) to map documents to typed domain objects and convert
  `Timestamp` to plain values at the boundary.

## Writes: batches and transactions

- **Batch** independent writes that must all apply together (create project + owner membership).
- **Transaction** when a write depends on a read (decrement stock, increment counter with a cap).
  Transactions retry; keep them free of side effects (no emails, no external calls inside).
- Respect batch/transaction size and per-request limits (verify current limits).
- Prefer `updateDoc` with field paths and `increment()`/`arrayUnion()` over read-modify-write.

## Security rules

```
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{db}/documents {
    function signedIn() { return request.auth != null; }
    function isOwner(d) { return signedIn() && d.ownerId == request.auth.uid; }

    match /projects/{projectId} {
      allow read: if isOwner(resource.data);
      allow create: if isOwner(request.resource.data) && validProject(request.resource.data)
                    && request.resource.data.createdAt == request.time;
      allow update: if isOwner(resource.data) && validProject(request.resource.data)
                    && request.resource.data.diff(resource.data).affectedKeys()
                         .hasOnly(['name', 'status', 'updatedAt']);
      allow delete: if false; // soft delete via status, or server-only
    }
    function validProject(d) {
      return d.keys().hasOnly(['ownerId','name','status','createdAt','updatedAt'])
        && d.name is string && d.name.size() > 0 && d.name.size() <= 120
        && d.status in ['active', 'archived'];
    }
  }
}
```

- Nothing outside explicit `match` blocks is allowed; never ship `allow read, write: if true` or
  time-boxed test rules.
- Rules are not filters: a query must be constrained so every possible result passes the rule
  (e.g. include `where('ownerId', '==', uid)`).
- `get()`/`exists()` in rules cost reads and have per-request limits; prefer custom claims for roles.
- Roles live in custom claims (set by admin SDK) or a server-written doc; clients never write their own role.
- Test with `@firebase/rules-unit-testing` against the emulator: an allow and a deny test per rule.
  See `references/rules-testing.md`.
- Enable App Check for production web apps to reduce abuse of public config.

## Auth

- Client: `onAuthStateChanged` once (in a plugin/composable), exposed as reactive state. In
  nuxt-vuefire: `useCurrentUser()` and `await getCurrentUser()` in route middleware.
- SSR needs the user on the server: use session cookies or nuxt-vuefire's auth SSR support (verify
  setup for your version), and verify tokens with firebase-admin in `server/`. Otherwise make
  authenticated routes `ssr: false`.
- Never trust a uid sent in a request body; derive it from the verified token.

## Cloud Functions (v2)

```ts
import { onDocumentCreated } from 'firebase-functions/v2/firestore'
import { setGlobalOptions } from 'firebase-functions/v2'
setGlobalOptions({ region: 'us-central1', maxInstances: 10 })

export const onOrderCreated = onDocumentCreated(
  { document: 'orders/{orderId}', retry: true },
  async (event) => {
    const processed = db.doc(`_processedEvents/${event.id}`)
    await db.runTransaction(async (tx) => {
      if ((await tx.get(processed)).exists) return   // idempotency guard
      tx.set(processed, { at: FieldValue.serverTimestamp() })
      tx.update(db.doc(`stats/global`), { orders: FieldValue.increment(1) })
    })
  },
)
```

- Triggers are at-least-once: make handlers idempotent (event id ledger, deterministic doc ids).
- Enable `retry` only for idempotent handlers; bound retries by checking event age.
- Secrets via `defineSecret` / Secret Manager, never in code or `runtimeConfig.public`.
- Long or heavy work goes to a task queue or scheduled function; the UI shows progress from a status doc.
- Set `maxInstances` to cap runaway cost. Watch for trigger loops (a function writing to the doc that triggers it).

## Client SDK and Nuxt integration

- Initialize once (plugin or nuxt-vuefire config). Import only what you use from `firebase/firestore`,
  `firebase/auth`; lazy-load heavy modules (Storage, Analytics) where they are needed.
- Prefer one-time reads (`getDocs`) for SSR pages; use realtime listeners (`onSnapshot`,
  `useCollection`) only where live updates matter, and unsubscribe on unmount (VueFire does this).
- Offline cache: `initializeFirestore(app, { localCache: persistentLocalCache(...) })` only for apps
  that benefit; it adds bundle size.
- Convert SDK types at the repository boundary before they reach the SSR payload (`nuxt-data-ssr`).

## Emulator Suite

`firebase emulators:start --import=./.emulator-data --export-on-exit` for local dev with seed data.
Connect the client conditionally in dev (`connectFirestoreEmulator`, `connectAuthEmulator`). CI runs
rules tests and function tests against emulators. Never develop against production data.

## Anti-patterns (AI slop tells)

- Normalized "SQL tables" with client-side joins (N+1 reads per list).
- Counting by `getDocs(...).size`, or loading a whole collection to filter/sort client-side.
- `offset` pagination; unbounded `onSnapshot` on large collections.
- Arrays of comments/messages inside one document.
- Test-mode rules in production, or rules that check auth but not shape/fields.
- Client writes `role: 'admin'` or `price` fields; uid taken from request body.
- Non-idempotent triggers; functions with no `maxInstances`; secrets in source.
- `firebase/compat/*` imports, or importing all of `firebase` in a client bundle.
- `any`-typed document data spread straight into components.

## Done checklist

- [ ] Each screen's queries listed; model serves them with bounded reads; indexes in `firestore.indexes.json`.
- [ ] Cursor pagination; no offset; no client-side filtering of large sets.
- [ ] Rules deny by default, validate shape/fields/immutables, and have allow + deny emulator tests.
- [ ] Privileged writes go through Functions/Nitro with verified tokens.
- [ ] Functions are idempotent, capped, use secrets properly, and avoid trigger loops.
- [ ] Modular SDK, single init, typed converters, SDK types converted before SSR payload.
- [ ] Cost estimate written for the hottest screen (reads per view x expected views).

## Firestore modeling worked examples

### Method

1. Write the access patterns as a table: screen, query, sort, page size, frequency, freshness.
2. For each, design the cheapest document read that answers it.
3. Decide where duplicated data lives and who keeps it consistent (client batch, trigger, never).
4. Write rules alongside the model; a model you cannot secure with rules needs a server path.
5. Estimate reads/writes per day for the top three screens.

### Example: freelance client portal

Access patterns:

| Screen | Query | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| My projects | projects where memberIds contains uid, order by updatedAt desc, 20/page | most frequent |
| Project detail | project doc + latest 30 activity items | |
| Project tasks board | tasks of project where status in [...], order by position | realtime |
| Admin dashboard | totals: active projects, open tasks, invoiced this month | must be O(1) reads |

Model:

```
projects/{projectId}
  name, status, clientName, ownerId, memberIds: string[], updatedAt, createdAt,
  counts: { openTasks: number, doneTasks: number }        // aggregation fields
projects/{projectId}/tasks/{taskId}
  title, status, position, assignee: { uid, name, photoURL } // denormalized
projects/{projectId}/activity/{activityId}
  type, actor: { uid, name }, at, summary                   // append-only, written by functions
stats/{yyyy-mm}
  activeProjects, openTasks, invoicedMinor                  // written only by functions
```

Indexes:
- `projects`: `memberIds` (array-contains) + `updatedAt desc`.
- `tasks`: `status` + `position asc` (collection scope).

Consistency:
- `counts.openTasks` updated in the same batch as the task status change (client) only if rules can
  validate the delta; otherwise by an `onDocumentWritten` trigger on tasks.
- When a user changes display name, a function fans out updates to `assignee.name` copies. Accept
  short staleness; document it.
- `memberIds` capped (e.g. 50) and validated in rules; larger teams need a `memberships` collection.

### Example: booking / availability

Avoid computing availability by reading every booking. Precompute:

```
resources/{resourceId}/days/{yyyy-mm-dd}
  slots: { "09:00": "free" | "held" | "booked", ... }   // bounded map, one doc per day
bookings/{bookingId}
  resourceId, day, slot, userId, status, createdAt
```

Booking is a transaction: read the day doc, verify slot free, set slot to `booked`, create booking.
A single day doc is a write hotspot only at extreme volume; shard by resource if needed.

### Example: chat / comments

```
threads/{threadId}                 lastMessage: { text, at, authorName }, participantIds, updatedAt
threads/{threadId}/messages/{id}   text, authorId, at
```

- Thread list reads only `threads` (with `lastMessage` denormalized), never messages.
- Messages paginate backward with `orderBy('at','desc').limit(30)` + `startAfter`.
- Unread counts per user: `threads/{id}/readState/{uid}` with `lastReadAt`, or a per-user
  `inbox/{uid}/threads/{threadId}` fan-out for large participant lists.

### Choosing duplication strategy

| Data changes... | Strategy |
| --- | --- |
| Never (author at time of post) | Copy at write time, never update |
| Rarely (display name, avatar) | Copy + trigger fan-out, tolerate brief staleness |
| Often and must be exact (price, stock) | Do not copy; read source, or reference by id + fetch |

### Cost sanity check

`reads_per_view x views_per_day x 30`. If the hottest screen costs more than a few reads per view,
look for: missing aggregation doc, list rendering requiring per-item reads, realtime listeners on
broad queries re-firing, or rules using `get()` per document.

## Testing security rules with the emulator

### Setup

```bash
npm i -D @firebase/rules-unit-testing vitest
firebase emulators:exec --only firestore "vitest run tests/rules"
```

```ts
// tests/rules/projects.test.ts
import { readFileSync } from 'node:fs'
import {
  initializeTestEnvironment, assertFails, assertSucceeds, type RulesTestEnvironment,
} from '@firebase/rules-unit-testing'
import { doc, getDoc, setDoc, updateDoc, serverTimestamp } from 'firebase/firestore'
import { beforeAll, afterAll, beforeEach, describe, it } from 'vitest'

let env: RulesTestEnvironment

beforeAll(async () => {
  env = await initializeTestEnvironment({
    projectId: 'demo-Sumitsubo',            // demo-* ids never touch real projects
    firestore: { rules: readFileSync('firestore.rules', 'utf8') },
  })
})
afterAll(() => env.cleanup())
beforeEach(() => env.clearFirestore())

async function seedProject(id: string, ownerId: string) {
  await env.withSecurityRulesDisabled(async (ctx) => {
    await setDoc(doc(ctx.firestore(), `projects/${id}`), {
      ownerId, name: 'Site', status: 'active', createdAt: new Date(), updatedAt: new Date(),
    })
  })
}

describe('projects', () => {
  it('owner can read own project', async () => {
    await seedProject('p1', 'alice')
    const db = env.authenticatedContext('alice').firestore()
    await assertSucceeds(getDoc(doc(db, 'projects/p1')))
  })

  it('other user cannot read', async () => {
    await seedProject('p1', 'alice')
    const db = env.authenticatedContext('bob').firestore()
    await assertFails(getDoc(doc(db, 'projects/p1')))
  })

  it('owner cannot change ownerId', async () => {
    await seedProject('p1', 'alice')
    const db = env.authenticatedContext('alice').firestore()
    await assertFails(updateDoc(doc(db, 'projects/p1'), { ownerId: 'bob' }))
  })

  it('rejects unknown fields on create', async () => {
    const db = env.authenticatedContext('alice').firestore()
    await assertFails(setDoc(doc(db, 'projects/p2'), {
      ownerId: 'alice', name: 'X', status: 'active',
      createdAt: serverTimestamp(), updatedAt: serverTimestamp(), isPaid: true,
    }))
  })

  it('unauthenticated cannot list', async () => {
    const db = env.unauthenticatedContext().firestore()
    await assertFails(getDoc(doc(db, 'projects/p1')))
  })
})
```

### What to cover per collection

- Read: owner allowed, non-owner denied, unauthenticated denied.
- List queries: constrained query allowed, unconstrained query denied.
- Create: valid allowed; missing field, extra field, wrong type, spoofed owner each denied.
- Update: allowed fields only; immutable fields (`ownerId`, `createdAt`) denied; role escalation denied.
- Delete: matches intended policy.
- Custom claims: `authenticatedContext('admin', { role: 'admin' })` for role-gated paths.

### Rule-writing helpers

```
function unchanged(field) {
  return request.resource.data[field] == resource.data[field];
}
function onlyChanges(fields) {
  return request.resource.data.diff(resource.data).affectedKeys().hasOnly(fields);
}
function hasRole(role) {
  return request.auth != null && request.auth.token.role == role;
}
```

### CI

Run rules tests on every change to `firestore.rules`, `storage.rules` or the data model. Deploy rules
from the repository (`firebase deploy --only firestore:rules,firestore:indexes`), never by editing in
the console.
